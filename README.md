Attiny 85 Decade Counter
=============

This project puts an attiny 85 and a neopixel into a decade counter.

The decade counter in question is available from adafruit (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1082 "Mechanical Decade Counters").  Each stock counter has 10 pins and a common ground, with this replacement board the values can be read using an i2c connection on a common bus.

There are three sections, the circuit design for kicad, an arduino sketch with some awful code in it and lastly a few photos of the finished product.

The neopixel was included to hopefully shine some rgb light out the viewing window.  However in practice this light can't be seen.  3D printing a replacement dial is the next step in this project.
